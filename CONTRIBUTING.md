# How to contribute

Welcome to the `covid-dashboard` repository.
This project is a community effort in response to the current COVID-19 epidemic.

We welcome contributions from any community member.

These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved.
If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by opening an [issue][link_issues].

Already know what you're looking for in this guide?
Jump to the following sections:

* [Understanding issues](#understanding-issues)
* [Making a change](#making-a-change)

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in.
Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

## Understanding issues

Every project on GitHub uses [issues][link_issues] slightly differently.
We consider **issues** as individual pieces of work that need to be completed to move the project forwards.
A general guideline: if you find yourself tempted to write a large issue that
is difficult to describe as one unit of work, please consider splitting it into two or more issues.

### Issue labels

The current list of labels are [here][link_labels] and include:

* [![Enhancement](https://img.shields.io/badge/-enhancement-84b6eb.svg)][link_enhancement] *These issues are asking for enhancements to be added to the project.*

    Please try to make sure that your enhancement is comptable with
    [the project vision dicussed in the README][link_README].

* [![Good First Issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-7057ff.svg)][link_goodfirst] *These issues describe tasks that a member of the team has determined are a good place to start work on the project.*

    If you feel that you can contribute to one of these issues, we especially encourage you to do so!

* [![Bugs](https://img.shields.io/badge/-bugs-fc2929.svg)][link_bugs] *These issues point to problems in the project.*

    If you find new a bug, please give as much detail as possible in your issue, including steps to recreate the error.
    If you experience the same bug as one already listed, please add any additional information that you have as a comment.


## Making a change

We appreciate all contributions to `covid-dashboard`,
but those accepted fastest will follow a workflow similar to the following:

### 1. Comment on an existing issue or [open a new issue][link_createissue] referencing your addition

This allows other members of the `covid-dashboard` development team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

[This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

### 2. [Fork][link_fork] the [covid-dashboard repository][link_covid-dashboard] to your GitHub profile

This is now your own unique and online copy of `covid-dashboard`.
Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Remember to [clone your fork][link_clonerepo] of `covid-dashboard` to your local machine,
which will allow you to make local changes to `covid-dashboard`.

Make sure to always [keep your fork up to date][link_updateupstreamwiki] with the master repository before and after making changes.

### 3. Make the changes you've discussed

Try to keep the changes focused to the issue.
We've found that working on a [new branch][link_branches] for each issue makes it easier to keep your changes targeted.
Using a new branch allows you to follow the standard GitHub workflow when making changes.
[This guide][link_gitworkflow] provides a useful overview for this workflow.

## Thank you

Stay safe, and stay well!
